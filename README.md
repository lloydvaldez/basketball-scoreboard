# Basketball Scoreboard
This is a basketball scoreboard web app solo project I made while taking Scrimba's JavaScript course. One of my first projects while learning JavaScript.

## What I learned making this project
- Getting elements and assigning them to variables
- Working with buttons with onClick functionality to increment the score and starting a new game
